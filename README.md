# Titanic Marconi Map

This is a 3D map depicting the exchange of wireless messages in the North Atlantic on April 15th, 1912 - the morning the Titanic sank.

Use the slider to change the time, and make sure to mouse over the text to see it in Morse Code - which of course is how the messages were actually being delivered.

If you find yourself in a long, messageless stretch, you can always use the next/previous message buttons at the top to speed along to the next or previous mssage.

In terms of sources, this project mainly uses CanadaDan's interpretation of the message logs, but with the timings adjusted to those given by Paul Lee. The ship locations are also from Paul Lee's map.
