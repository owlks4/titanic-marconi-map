# Titanic Marconi Messages Map

A 3D map depicting the exchange of wireless messages in the North Atlantic on April 15th, 1912 - the morning the Titanic sank.

('Marconi' refers to the Marconi wireless communication technology employed by most of the ships on the map.)

## Instructions:

* Left mouse button + drag: Rotate camera.
* Right mouse button + drag: Move camera.
* Scroll: Zoom in/out.

Use the slider to change the time, and mouse over the messages to see them in Morse Code - which is how the messages were actually being delivered.

You can always use the next/previous message buttons at the top to speed along to the next or previous mssage if you find yourself in a long, messageless stretch.

In terms of sources, this project mainly uses CanadaDan's interpretation of the message logs, but with the timings adjusted to those given by Paul Lee.
