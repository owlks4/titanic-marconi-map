"note":"I've used CanadaDan's message transcription for this, because it attributes the content of the messages to their speakers, rather than reporting the paraphrases written down by the recipients, which is how they are listed in the primary sources. The latter method is more accurate, but doesn't translate as well to a format like this, where the speakers are portrayed sending the messages in the first instance. So this gives a better impression of what was said, but is not *actually* what was said, because no such direct transcription exists. If you *are* interested in the actual logs, rather than a portrayal, do check out Dr Paul Lee's website here http://www.paullee.com/titanic/pv.php",
