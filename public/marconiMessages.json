"note":"I've used CanadaDan's message transcription for this (except corrected to Paul Lee's timings), because it attributes the content of the messages to their speakers, rather than reporting the paraphrases written down by the recipients, which is how they are listed in the primary sources. The latter method is more accurate, but doesn't translate as well to a format like this, where the speakers are portrayed sending the messages in the first instance. So this gives a better impression of what was said, but is not actually what was said, because no vessel made a direct transcription on the night. If you *are* interested in the actual logs, rather than a portrayal, do check out Dr Paul Lee's website here http://www.paullee.com/titanic/pv.php",
